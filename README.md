# Quote Generator (Java)

## 📌 Project Description

The **Quote Generator** is a simple Java-based application that displays random inspirational, motivational, or thoughtful quotes each time it is run. This project is beginner-friendly and is designed to help learners understand core Java concepts such as arrays, classes, methods, random number generation, and basic input/output operations.

This project can be extended into a console application, GUI application (using Swing/JavaFX), or even a backend service for a web application.
